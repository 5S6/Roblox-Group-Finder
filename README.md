# Roblox-Group-Finder
A tool to help you find unowned/ownerless roblox groups :)


- It's really easy, all you need is a discord webhook :)


- It will not send locked groups so don't worry LOLLL.


- I personally use like 5 million threads, but ngl 500 - 100,000 threads is fine :D


- On Line 13 Of Main.py Change That To The Range You Want To Scan.


- If You Want To Run It On Replit, Just Fork This :)
